Software Engineering graduate with commercial experience building C#/.NET enterprise applications and RESTful APIs. I enjoy working on data-driven, scalable systems and learning how software supports real-world engineering and industrial use cases.

I have hands-on experience in Agile environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams to translate business requirements into reliable software solutions. Currently seeking opportunities to grow as a Software Developer, with a strong interest in backend development, system design, and industrial software.
